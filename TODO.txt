TODO:
make save update tab name

comment coloring still needs work

update ctrl i to work on new tabs

disable dev colors not currently working,
works temporarily on main window
doesnt work at all on tabs

best course of action is probably to refactor
the currentTab function

add ctrl-x with no selection cuts whole line(-\n)
